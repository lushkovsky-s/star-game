# Stars game

Stack: Vue 3, Vuex, vue-flow

## Usage

Install:
```
npm i
```

Run:
```
npm run dev
```

## Other

QA:
- Why not to port some parts to css (background as a gradient, star shape):
  It'll be easier to customize the game (e.g. change stars to cities)
  For otimization purposes it's better to deliver through some cdn like uploadcare

Doubts:
- Use React: poor ui frameworks (50% doesn't support vue3, hard to do styles - check chakra), poor custom modules support, poor vim support, poor community, harder debug
